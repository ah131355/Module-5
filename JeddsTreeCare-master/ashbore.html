  <h1>Ash Bore</h1>
<img src="images/ashborer.jpg" alt="bug">
<p>Emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, is an exotic beetle that was discovered in southeastern Michigan near Detroit in the summer of 2002. The adult beetles nibble on ash foliage but cause little damage. The larvae (the immature stage) feed on the inner bark of ash trees, disrupting the tree's ability to transport water and nutrients. Emerald ash borer probably arrived in the United States on solid wood packing material carried in cargo ships or airplanes originating in its native Asia. As of February 2018, it is now found in 32 states, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and Manitoba. Since its discovery, EAB has:

<li>Killed hundreds of millions of ash trees in North America.</li>
<li>Caused regulatory agencies and the USDA to enforce quarantines and fines to prevent potentially infested ash trees, logs or hardwood firewood from moving out of areas where EAB occurs.</li>
<li>Cost municipalities, property owners, nursery operators and forest products industries hundreds of millions of dollars.</li></p>
